\subsection { Navigation }

The Android App is built around the so-called Drawer Navigation. This kind of navigation is based on a so-called Hamburger button which in case of the Planes App is displayed in the top left corner of the screen. Tapping on the button displays a list possible destinations in the application. These depend on whether the app is played in the Single Player or Multiplayer Mode. 

In the case of the Single Player App we have:
\begin{itemize}
\item Game
\item Videos
\item Settings
\item Info
\end{itemize}

For the Multiplayer App more screens are available:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Game
	\item Connect to Game
	\item Game Statistics
	\item Login
	\item Logout
	\item Register
	\item Delete User
	\item Videos
	\item Settings
	\item Info
\end{itemize}

When a screen is selected, a Fragment of the Fragment Class corresponding to the screen is loaded into the main layout of the application.
