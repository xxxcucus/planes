<h1>Planes</h1>

<p>Planes is a strategy game for two persons and a variant of the Battleships game.</p>

<p>The game is played on a 10x10 board. Each player has his / her own board where he / she places 3 planes. The planes consist of 10 grid squares representing wings, body, tail and cockpit. The planes are not allowed to overlap on the board. The goal of the game is to guess the position of the opponent's plane cockpits before the opponent guesses the same for your planes. The players do not see the opponent's board, they are only allowed to make (educated) guesses on where the cockpits might be.</p>

<p>After each player has positioned his / her planes a set of guessing turns are performed. Each player is allowed to unveil a square on the opponent's board and the opponent tells what was unveiled: a miss, that means there was no plane there, a hit, that means a part of the plane is there but it is not the cockpit, and dead, that means a cockpit was found.</p>

<p>It is possible to have a draw when both players guess the other player's cockpits in the same number of turns. </p>

<p>A variation of the game specifies that when a cockpit was guessed all the grid squares corresponding to that plane are communicated to the player who made the correct guess.</p>
