//The computer is trying to guess where the player's planes are

//contains all the knowledge that the computer has
//about the corresponding plane

//For each computer guess there can be 3 results
//Miss - the guess is not on a plane
//Hit - the guess is on a plane but it is not on the plane's head
//Dead - the guess is the plane's head
//describes the data that is available about a given plane position
//This structure keeps the information about the position of the head of the planes
